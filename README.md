# 🧠 Customer Behaviour Analysis — EDA Project  

## 📝 Project Overview  

The dataset consists of **250,000 records and 13 columns**, covering customer demographics, purchase behaviour, product categories, payment methods, returns, and churn status. The main objective was to analyze and visualize trends that help businesses understand their customers better — improving retention, marketing effectiveness, and revenue generation.  


## ⚙️ Tools & Libraries Used  

- **Python**  
- **Jupyter Notebook**  
- **NumPy** – numerical computations  
- **Pandas** – data cleaning & manipulation  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – visual analytics


## 🔍 EDA Workflow  

### 1. Data Import & Overview  
- Loaded dataset (250k rows × 13 columns).  
- Reviewed data types, structure, and missing values.  

### 2. Data Cleaning  
- Removed duplicates and handled missing data.  
- Standardized column names and formats (e.g., date-time conversion).  

### 3. Feature Exploration  
- Studied customer demographics (age, gender).  
- Analyzed product categories, payment methods, and returns.  
- Calculated total spending and average purchase values.  

### 4. Univariate & Bivariate Analysis  
- Visualized individual features (histograms, count plots).  
- Compared categorical features (e.g., gender vs churn).  
- Correlation heatmap to identify relationships.  

### 5. Outlier Detection  
- Detected price and quantity anomalies using box plots.  

### 6. Churn Analysis  
- Explored key factors contributing to customer churn.  
- Compared spending habits and engagement of churned vs retained customers.  


## 📊 Key Insights  

- **Top Product Categories:** Electronics and Home products have the highest purchase volume.  
- **Payment Methods:** Credit Card and PayPal dominate customer transactions.  
- **Customer Age:** Majority of customers are between **25–45 years old** — the most active spending group.  
- **Returns:** Customers with higher return rates tend to have a higher churn probability.  
- **Churn Behaviour:** Loyal customers make frequent, moderate purchases across diverse categories, while churned customers show inconsistent engagement.  


## 📈 Visualizations  

The notebook includes a range of insightful visualizations:  

- 📊 **Customer Distribution:** by gender and age group  
- 🏷️ **Product Category Sales:** comparison using bar plots  
- 💳 **Payment Method Usage:** share among customers   
- 🚪 **Churn Distribution:** churned vs retained customers  


## 💡 Conclusion  

This project provides actionable insights to:  

- Improve customer retention by identifying churn-prone segments  
- Optimize marketing strategies for top-performing categories  
- Understand the influence of demographics on customer spending  

It demonstrates the **complete EDA lifecycle** — from data cleaning and feature exploration to visualization and insight generation — a key skill set for aspiring Data Analysts.
